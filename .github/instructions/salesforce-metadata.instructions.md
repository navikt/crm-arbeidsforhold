# Salesforce metadata standards

For new or materially changed Salesforce metadata in the main package:

- Confirm that the path belongs to `force-app/` and not a package-owned or reference-only directory before editing.
- Preserve Salesforce source format, metadata type names, API versions, and existing public names unless the task includes an approved migration plan.
- Use English for metadata and API identifiers. Use descriptive PascalCase for new custom objects and fields, with no unnecessary underscores beyond Salesforce-required suffixes.
- Keep labels, descriptions, help text, permissions, and automation understandable to both administrators and developers. Translate user-facing text through the established translation pattern.
- Prefer existing Custom Metadata, Custom Labels, permission sets, Named Credentials, and established package dependencies over hardcoded configuration.
- For Flows and declarative automation, keep entry criteria explicit, avoid duplicated business rules, handle fault paths, and keep orchestration separate from reusable logic where practical.
- Treat permission sets, sharing, field-level security, Experience Cloud access, and metadata visibility as security-sensitive. Require human review for access changes.
- Before deployment-related actions, use a local deploy preview or the repository's validation workflow. Deployment, package creation, promotion, and org changes require explicit user approval.
- Review design changes against Salesforce Well-Architected: Trusted, Easy, and Adaptable. State important dependencies, failure behaviour, packageability, and rollback considerations.
- Add or update focused tests for behaviour affected by metadata changes, and report when validation requires an authenticated Salesforce org.
